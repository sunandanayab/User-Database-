# SQL Backend with Java Program, User Registration, and User Login Authentication

# Description
This project demonstrates how to create a table using SQL backend, and then implement a Java program to collect user credentials (name and password) and store them in an Oracle database. Additionally, the project includes a Java program for user login authentication, which verifies if the entered credentials match the records stored in the Oracle database.

# Technologies Used
* JAVA
* OOPs(Object Oriented Programming)
* JDBC
* Oracle Database

# Installation
* Install the required dependencies:
* Oracle Database to set up the database environment.
* Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the Java program.
* Ensure that you have a compatible JDBC driver for Oracle, such as Oracle JDBC Driver.
* Set up the Oracle database by executing the necessary SQL statements to create the required table structure. You can find the SQL statements in the database.sql 
  file in the repository.
* Update the database connection configuration in the Java program (Main.java) to match your Oracle database setup.

# Usage
  * Compile the Java files using the following command: 
   1. For package-based file
      * javac -d . FileName.java
   2. For main program
      * javac FileName.java(Compilation)
      * java FileName (Running)
* Follow the command prompt interface prompts to enter the user's name and password.
* The program will store the user's credentials in the Oracle database.
